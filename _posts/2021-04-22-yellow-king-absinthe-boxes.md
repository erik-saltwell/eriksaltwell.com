My friend and amazing GM, 	[Ethan Schoonover](https://ethanschoonover.com/) has been running [The Yellow King RPG](https://pelgranepress.com/product-category/gumshoe/yellow-king/) for us, and we had a great scene involving absinthe served filtered through  a cube made from the ground bones of the first King of France.  In commemoration I made the players commemorative boxes of Absinthe.
