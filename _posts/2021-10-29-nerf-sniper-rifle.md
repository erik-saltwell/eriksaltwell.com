For one of my COVID quaruntine projects, I decided to make Lil Billy.

Billy started life as a Nerf Longshot.

I replaced all of its internals to use the air pressure from a paintball tank.  Then I added a 3 foot long brass barrel and painted it.

Unfortunately, it kept blowing my darts apart, so I ended up 3D printing a special back to hold it in place.

I had hoped that the gun would shoot super sonic darts, but the trigger failed before I could get the pressure up that high.  You can see my testing rig here.

It did, however, go right through this quarter inch plywood.

It also dented the plywood behind the first one.
