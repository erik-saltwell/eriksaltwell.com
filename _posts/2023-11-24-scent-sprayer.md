I have been super excited to play [Stras Acimovic](https://twitter.com/strasa) and [John LeBeouf-Little](https://twitter.com/worldnamer)'s dark military rpg: [Band of Blades](https://offguardgames.com/band-of-blades/). It has great Forged in the Dark mechanics and the amazing feels of Glen Cook's [Black Company](https://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Black-Company-Glen-Cook/dp/0765319233/) books.  Anyhow, while I have been waiting for my existing campaign's to wrap up, I have been building out accessories to use in play, including:
- A laser-engraved leather map.
- Leather guidebooks for each role.
- 3D printed pieces to represent the current location of the legion on the map.
- 3D printed unit tokens to track the history of victories and failures over the campaign.
