Every year around Halloween I run a horror RPG session using the [Dread](https://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/games/dread/) roleplaying game.  For the past few years a running theme in my game has been the presence of the smell of sugar cookies when the players are in the presence of comsmic horror.  The idea was to contrast something horrible with something sweet and innocent.

I wanted to find a way for the players, not just the characters, to develop a dear response to this sweet smell, so during the game I wanted a way to distribute the smell of sugar cookies throughout our play area.

Behold: The Scent Sprayer.

It is just a holder for a PC case fan that is placed over a scented candle.  The increased airflow improves the burn rate of the candle and distributes the smell over a wide area.   From the front you can see the on-off switch.
