I am about to finish off an epic, level 1-20 5th edition dnd campaign that I have been running for my friends.  The name of the campaign is Burnished Copper, and as a finishing gift, I have 3d printed them dice jails featuring one of the epic monsters from the campaign.

Here they are just after putting down the base coat of paint.

And here is one after dry brushing - ready to wrap up and give to one of my players!
